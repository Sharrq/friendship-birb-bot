The only requirement we have for community raids is ilvl - You should be at ilvl ${NORMAL_ILVL} or higher for normal, and ilvl ${HEROIC_ILVL} or higher for heroic. All times are Eastern.

**Sunday, 8pm** FuT Beer Run (normal ABT)
**Monday, 8pm** Denny's (heroic ABT)
**Wednesday, 3:30pm** Normal ABT with Afternoon Delight
**Thursday, 3:30pm** Afternoon Delight (heroic ABT)
**Friday, 7pm** Pregame Raid (normal Gar>Agg>Argus)
**Friday, 10pm** The Drunk Raid (fun random shenanigans) aka "ARD After Dark" - attend at your own risk
**Saturday, 10:30pm** Normal ABT`;
