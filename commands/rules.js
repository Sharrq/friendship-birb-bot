Many of our members are casual players, and everyone was new at one point. If you aren√≠t here to have a good time, help people learn, and make a few jokes along the way, it may be best if you move along.

${reactionNumbers[2]} **No politics.  No religion.**
Just not worth the headache.

${reactionNumbers[3]} **No inappropriate names or profile pictures**.
Our ${generalChannel} channel is PG-13. We do not allow for lewd or inflammatory user names or discord profile pictures.

${reactionNumbers[4]} **Zero tolerance for sales**
