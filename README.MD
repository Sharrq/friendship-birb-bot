Some things to remember for the actual run

:one: On Pull, stand in front of the boss and die to the frontal cleave. This ensures that mechanics are targted onto our people so there are no unnecessary wipes.
:two: When the boss kills the entire raid team, Release Spirit and avoid the Sha creatures. Do NOT walk into the tree.
:three: while in the ghost phase, collect small orbs to give the raid team a damage buff.
:four: Once you have your mount, we would appreciate it if you send a screenshot of you on your new mount to us on Twitter @WoW_ARD with the hashtag #FriendshipBirb.
